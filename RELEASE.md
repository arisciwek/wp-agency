# WP Agency Plugin v1.0.7

**Release Date**: 2025-01-23
**Type**: Feature Release
**Priority**: High

## 🎯 Release Highlights

This release focuses on **architectural improvements** and **developer extensibility**, migrating demo data generators to production-quality runtime flows and implementing a comprehensive hook system for third-party integrations.

---

## ✨ Added

### 🔌 Comprehensive Hook System (TODO-2066)
- **9 Action Hooks** for entity lifecycle management:
  - `wp_agency_agency_created` - Fired after agency creation
  - `wp_agency_agency_before_delete` - Before agency deletion (validation)
  - `wp_agency_agency_deleted` - After agency deleted
  - `wp_agency_division_created` - Fired after division creation
  - `wp_agency_division_before_delete` - Before division deletion
  - `wp_agency_division_deleted` - After division deleted
  - `wp_agency_employee_created` - Fired after employee creation
  - `wp_agency_employee_before_delete` - Before employee deletion
  - `wp_agency_employee_deleted` - After employee deleted

- **8 Filter Hooks** documented for future implementation:
  - Permission filters (can_create_employee, can_create_division, max_inspector_assignments)
  - UI/UX filters (enable_export, company_detail_tabs)
  - System filters (debug_mode)
  - Integration filters (wilayah province/regency options)

- **AutoEntityCreator Handler**:
  - Auto-creates "Division Pusat" when agency is created
  - Auto-creates employee when division is created
  - Ensures consistent data structure across all agencies

- **Complete Documentation**:
  - `/docs/hooks/README.md` - Main hook reference
  - `/docs/hooks/actions/` - Action hooks documentation
  - `/docs/hooks/filters/` - Filter hooks documentation
  - `/docs/hooks/examples/` - Real-world integration examples
  - Updated README.md with hooks integration guide

### 🔄 Runtime Flow Architecture (TODO-2070)
- **Employee Demo Generator Migration**:
  - Migrated from bulk generation to runtime flow pattern
  - Zero production code pollution (removed `createDemoEmployee()`)
  - Full validation via `AgencyEmployeeValidator`
  - Lifecycle hooks properly triggered
  - Dynamic division mapping for varying IDs
  - Generated 87 employees (29 from division hook + 58 from demo data)

---

## 🔧 Changed

### Architecture Improvements
- **Demo Generator Pattern**:
  - Employee generator now follows: User first → Validator → Model → Hook
  - Consistent with Agency and Division patterns
  - Consistent with wp-customer plugin patterns
  - Production code stays clean (no demo methods)

### Data Generation
- **User Creation Flow**:
  - WordPress users created via `wp_insert_user()` (static IDs 170-229)
  - Enhanced cache clearing for WordPress user operations
  - Fixed 20 duplicate usernames by swapping name order
  - Validator enhanced to allow existing WP users

### Developer Experience
- **Hook System**:
  - Extensible architecture for third-party plugins
  - Soft delete and hard delete support via hooks
  - Before-delete hooks allow validation/prevention
  - After-delete hooks enable cascade cleanup

---

## 🐛 Fixed

### Employee Demo Data
- **Duplicate Usernames**: Fixed 20 users with duplicate usernames by swapping first/last names
- **Validation Rejection**: Enhanced `AgencyEmployeeValidator` to allow existing WordPress users
- **WordPress Cache**: Comprehensive cache clearing after user ID changes prevents stale data

### Data Integrity
- **Division Mapping**: Dynamic mapping handles varying division IDs correctly
- **Hook Cascade**: Properly preserves 29 admin employees created via division hook
- **Employee Count**: Accurate count (87 total: 29 auto-created + 58 from demo data)

---

## 🔨 Technical Changes

### Hook Implementation
- Registered all 9 lifecycle hooks in `wp-agency.php`
- Created `/src/Handlers/AutoEntityCreator.php` handler class
- Added `findByUserAndDivision()` method in `AgencyEmployeeModel`
- Implemented soft delete support (status='inactive')
- Implemented hard delete option (via settings)

### Runtime Flow Pattern
- Employee demo uses production validation (no bypasses)
- User creation integrated with WordPress core functions
- Cache-aware implementation prevents stale data
- Dynamic division mapping replaces hardcoded IDs

### Code Quality
- Removed demo methods from production controllers
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Pattern consistency across all entities
- Follows WordPress coding standards
